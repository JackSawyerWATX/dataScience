# Calculate the slope of the line passing through two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).

# Args:
#     x1 (float): x-coordinate of the first point.
#     y1 (float): y-coordinate of the first point.
#     x2 (float): x-coordinate of the second point.
#     y2 (float): y-coordinate of the second point.

# Returns:
#     float: The slope of the line.
