dataScience — repository overview

This repository contains small Python scripts used to explore and visualize a sample `data.csv` dataset. The scripts include data preparation utilities, plotting helpers, and small example programs.

## Python dependencies

Install the project dependencies with pip (recommended to use a virtual environment):

```powershell
py -m pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy
```

## Quick run examples (PowerShell)

Run data preparation and then any of the plotting examples below. Replace `py` with your Python launcher if different.

```powershell
# Clean the CSV first (recommended)
py .\dataPreparation.py

# Correlation (full): shows the plot and prompts to save (default file: correlation_plot.png)
py .\correlation.py

# Correlation (simplified): minimal interactive scatter using plt.show()
py .\correlation_simplified.py

# NewPlotGraph: coerces numeric columns, sets axis limits, saves to plot.png
py .\NewPlotGraph.py

# plottingFunctions: examples of line/area plots and helpers (may save files)
py .\plottingFunctions.py

# zero_correlation_coefficient: scatter of Duration vs Max_Pulse
py .\zero_correlation_coefficient.py

# negative_linear_correlation: example DataFrame demonstrating negative correlation
py .\negative_linear_correlation.py

# Example advanced usage for correlation.py (overrides and flags):
py .\correlation.py --out myplot.png        # save to myplot.png instead of default
py .\correlation.py --no-open               # do not open/show the plot window
py .\correlation.py --no-save               # attempt to show only (no save)
```

Note: some plotting scripts select a non-interactive backend when running headless; see each script's header for details and use `--no-save` or `--no-open` for interactive control.

## Files in this folder

Below is a concise description of each file currently present in the `dataScience` folder. Filenames are shown in code style and descriptions are short — open any file for details.

- `anArray.py`: small utilities to reverse arrays; demo of in-place and copy-based reversal.
- `correlation.py`: full-featured scatter plot for `Average_Pulse` vs `Calorie_Burnage`.
  - Attempts to use an interactive backend, shows the plot, and prompts whether to save to `correlation_plot.png` (override with `--out`).
- `correlation_plot.png`: example output image generated by `correlation.py` (binary image file).
- `correlation_simplified.py`: minimal scatter plot example; reads `data.csv` and calls `plt.show()` (interactive use).
- `data.csv`: sample dataset used by the scripts (CSV input file).
- `dataFrame.py`: (experimental) miscellaneous DataFrame examples / experiments — inspect the file for specifics.
- `dataPreparation.py`: robust CSV parsing and cleaning utilities; infers delimiters, normalizes NA values, coerces numeric columns and drops rows with missing values.
- `functions.py`: miscellaneous helper functions used while exploring the data (open file to see the helpers).
- `health_plot.jpg`: example image (binary file) in the repository.
- `input_something.py`: small script demonstrating interactive input (inspect the file for how it prompts the user).
- `negative_linear_correlation.py`: example that constructs a DataFrame demonstrating a negative correlation (hours worked vs calories burned) and plots a scatter plot.
- `NewPlotGraph.py`: plotting helper that coerces `Average_Pulse` and `Calorie_Burnage` to numeric, sets axis limits, saves `plot.png`, and attempts to open it on Windows. Uses `Agg` backend by default.
- `plot.png`: example output image generated by `NewPLotGraph.py` (binary image file).
- `plottingFunctions.py`: plotting utilities and examples; includes notes about headless plotting and how to save plots to disk or stdout.
- `randomNumber.py`: provides `countdown(n)` implemented iteratively (avoids recursion depth limits). When executed as a script it runs a countdown from 5000.
- `README.md`: this file.
- `requirements.txt`: lists core Python packages required (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`).
- `reshaping_arrays.py`: demonstrates NumPy array reshaping examples (`reshape` to 2D and 3D), using `-1` for an inferred dimension, and shows whether a reshape returns a view or copy.
- `slopeAndIntercept.py`: simple slope computation utilities and examples.
- `standard_deviation.py`: computes per-column standard deviation, mean, and coefficient of variation from `data.csv` and prints results; reads numbers with space-thousands.
- `standard_deviation_2.py`: alternate or intermediate version of the standard deviation script (inspect for differences).
- `variance.py`: computes and prints per-column variance for numeric columns (coerces numeric values and drops rows with missing data).
- `zero_correlation_coefficient.py`: plots `Duration` vs `Max_Pulse` (ensure columns are coerced to numeric to avoid categorical-axis errors).

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

- If `dropna()` appears to have no effect, check that the CSV was parsed into columns (not read as a single object column). Use the diagnostics in `data_preparation.py` to confirm parsing.
- If numeric columns contain values like `'9 000'` or `'AF'`, convert with `pd.to_numeric(..., errors='coerce')` and then `dropna` to remove non-numeric rows.
- If a local file shadows a standard library module (e.g., `random.py`), rename the local file to avoid import problems.

## Next steps (optional)

- Save cleaned CSV output from `data_preparation.py` as `cleaned_data.csv` for downstream scripts.
- Add an `examples/` folder with sample run commands and generated images.

 ## Next steps (optional)

 - I can save cleaned CSV output from `dataPreparation.py` as `cleaned_data.csv` for downstream scripts.
 - I can add an `examples/` folder with sample run commands and generated images.
 - I can add small example commands for each plotting script to the README (already added above).

# Python Libraries

- **NumPy**: numerical operations and N-dimensional arrays.
- **Matplotlib**: plotting and visualization.
- **SciPy**: scientific utilities, including linear algebra modules.
